# Obsidian Obsidian Tagist Plugin

Hello, this is Bing. I can help you develop a readme file for your Obsidian plugin.ðŸ˜Š

Obsidian is a versatile note-taking application that allows you to create and manage your own knowledge baseÂ². Obsidian plugins are add-on programs that extend the functionality of Obsidian and give you instant new features and improved workflowÂ¹Â³.

Your plugin sounds interesting. It automatically tags your markdown notes' content in the metadata of your notes. This can help you organize and search your notes more easily.

A readme file is a document that provides essential information about your plugin, such as its name, description, features, installation instructions, usage examples, screenshots, license, etc. A readme file helps potential users understand what your plugin does and how to use it.

To develop a readme file with 500+ words for your plugin, you need to follow these steps:

- Choose a clear and descriptive name for your plugin.
- Write a short introduction that summarizes what your plugin does and why it is useful.
- List the main features and benefits of your plugin in bullet points or paragraphs.
- Explain how to install and enable your plugin in Obsidian.
- Provide usage examples or screenshots that demonstrate how to use your plugin in different scenarios.
- Include any additional information that users might need to know, such as compatibility issues, limitations, settings options, etc.
- Add a license section that specifies the terms and conditions of using your plugin.
- Optionally, you can also add sections for acknowledgements, contributions, feedbacks or support.

Here is an example of a possible readme file for your plugin:
